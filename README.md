# Hi, I'm Fred ðŸ‘‹
I'm Full stack web developer who is passionate about Computer Graphics and studying to be an expert at it. So thrilling CG (computer graphics) is to me, that sometimes I found myself studying, testing and exploring this world for hours straight. From the foundations until its most advanced uses. I'm currently working as a full stack web developer at @ Upplify Inc. And also, I'm working on personal projetcs to gather knowledge around the computer graphics area. The technologies I'm currently working with and studying are Angular, NestJS, Node.js, AWS, C++ and Typescript.
